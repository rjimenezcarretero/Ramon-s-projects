I am a Mathematics student at the University of Granada with a strong focus on complex systems modeling and data analysis.
My academic background combines theoretical rigor —including differential equations, partial differential equations, statistics, and numerical analysis— with an applied and computational approach, using mathematics as a tool to understand, simulate, and optimize real-world phenomena.

I am currently developing my Bachelor’s Thesis on sports performance modeling. I am deeply interested in the new applications and advantages that Artificial Intelligence can offer, and I actively work to keep myself updated in this field.

I consider myself a perseverant and dedicated person, capable of structuring complex problems and transforming them into practical, measurable solutions. I also possess strong teamwork and communication skills, adaptability, and a high level of self-criticism aimed at continuous improvement.

I am looking to begin my career in projects where data analysis and AI integration form the foundation of my first professional experiences.
